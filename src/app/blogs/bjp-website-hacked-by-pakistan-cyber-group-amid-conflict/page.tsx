    <h2 id="cyber-war-heats-up" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem;">Cyber War Heats Up Amid Growing Conflict</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">In a major development early Saturday morning, users across India reported that the official website of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — India’s ruling political party — has been hacked. The homepage reportedly displayed pro-Pakistan messages and images before going completely offline.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">This incident comes during a tense and dangerous time, following airstrikes and a failing ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan.</p>

    <h2 id="what-happened" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem;">What Happened?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">Around 7:30 AM IST, users attempting to access <code>www.bjp.org</code> were met with a defaced page showing a green flag and the message:</p>
    <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic;">“This is just the beginning. You attacked our land, now feel our response — Pakistan Cyber Force.”</blockquote>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">Soon after, the website went offline completely, and many users reported error pages or “site under maintenance” messages.</p>

    <h2 id="no-official-response" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem;">No Official Response Yet</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">As of now, the Indian Government and the BJP have not released any official statement about the hacking incident. Cybersecurity experts in India are investigating the breach, and some reports say that sensitive internal files may have been accessed.</p>

    <h2 id="a-new-front-in-the-conflict" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem;">A New Front in the Conflict</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">This is not the first cyberattack during the current crisis. Several Pakistani government websites were also targeted earlier this week, allegedly by Indian hackers. With this latest attack, cyber warfare appears to be escalating fast.</p>

    <h2 id="public-reaction" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem;">Public Reaction</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">On social media, many users in India expressed anger and shock. Hashtags like <strong>#BJPWebsiteHacked</strong>, <strong>#CyberWar</strong>, and <strong>#IndiaPakistanConflict</strong> started trending within an hour of the attack. In Pakistan, some users celebrated the hack, calling it a “reply to Hyderabad and Bahawalpur.”</p>

    <h2 id="whats-next" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem;">What’s Next?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">Experts say this could lead to even more digital attacks on both sides. Governments are being urged to secure online platforms and avoid further escalation. But with military and now digital attacks increasing, the fear of a larger war is growing.</p>
